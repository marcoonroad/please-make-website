## ChatGPT Prompts

First prompt:
```
Can you make a website? A responsive one, with big pictures,
using my favorite fonts like Roboto, with fancy interactive
menus and loading faster even on limited / low-end devices?
```

Second prompt:
```
Show me an example of this website in a single page, with
CSS and JS included in this single HTML page / file.
```

Third prompt:

```
For the background image, assume this URL
https://www.marcoonroad.dev/please-make-website/background-open-office.jpg
instead of the URL https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800. Also,
improve the layout of menu buttons, the hover effect over
them seems very awkward, can you make them more clean?
```

## Adobe Firefly Prompts:

```
Gere uma imagem 1200x800 de um ambiente corporativo, mais
especificamente um escritório open-office de tecnologia bem
descontraído.
